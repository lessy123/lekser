live in virtue, no desire 
in the grave an angel's choir 
you look to heaven and wonder why 
no one can see them in the sky 
just as the clouds have gone to sleep 
angels can be seen in heaven's keep 
alone in fear they question why 
goddamn not an angel when i die 
angels live, they never die 
apart from us, behind the sky 
they're fading souls who've turned to ice 
so ashen white in paradise 
just as the clouds have gone to sleep 
angels can be seen in heaven's keep 
alone in fear they question why 
goddamn not an angel when i die 
goddamn an angel when i die 
heaven must be hell in the sky
